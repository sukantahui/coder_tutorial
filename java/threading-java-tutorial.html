            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The OS defines a job which has predefined sequence of commands, programs and data as a single unit.
              </li>
              <li>The OS keeps a number a jobs in memory and executes them without any manual information.</li>
              <li>Jobs are processed in the order of submission, i.e., first come first served fashion.</li>
              <li>When a job completes its execution, its memory is released and the output for the job gets copied into
                an output spool for later printing or processing.</li>

              <h5 class="card-title">Multitasking</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Multitasking is when multiple jobs are executed by the CPU simultaneously by switching between them. 
                Switches occur so frequently that the users may interact with each program while it is running. 
                An OS does the following activities related to multitasking −
              </p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The user gives instructions to the operating system or to a program directly, and receives an immediate response. </li>
                  <li>The OS handles multitasking in the way that it can handle multiple operations/executes multiple programs at a time.</li>
                  <li>Multitasking Operating Systems are also known as Time-sharing systems.</li>
                  <li>These Operating Systems were developed to provide interactive use of a computer system at a reasonable cost.</li>
                  <li>A time-shared operating system uses the concept of CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time-shared CPU.</li>
                  <li>Each user has at least one separate program in memory.</li>
                  <li>A program that is loaded into memory and is executing is commonly referred to as a process.</li>
                  <li>When a process executes, it typically executes for only a very short time before it either finishes or needs to perform I/O.</li>
                  <li>Since interactive I/O typically runs at slower speeds, it may take a long time to complete. During this time, a CPU can be utilized by another process.</li>
                  <li>The operating system allows the users to share the computer simultaneously. Since each action or command in a time-shared system tends to be short, only a little CPU time is needed for each user.</li>
                  <li>As the system switches CPU rapidly from one user/program to the next, each user is given the impression that he/she has his/her own CPU, whereas actually one CPU is being shared among many users.</li>

                    There are two types of multiprocessing, Symmetric Multiprocessing and Asymmetric Multiprocessing. Multiprocessing system has more than one processor and they can execute multiple process simultaneously. In Symmetric Multiprocessing, processors shares the same memory. In Asymmetric Multiprocessing there is a one master processor that controls the data structure of the system.
                    The primary difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric Multiprocessing is that in Symmetric Multiprocessing all the processor in the system run tasks in OS. But, in Asymmetric Multiprocessing only the master processor run task in OS.

            <h5 class="card-title">Multi Threading</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Multithreading refers to multiple threads being executed by a single CPU in such a way that each thread is executed in parallel fashion and CPU/processor is switched between them using context switch. Multithreading is a technique to increase the throughput of a processor. Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
              A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
              However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area. They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.
              Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.</p>
